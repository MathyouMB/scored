# Scored

Scored is an elixir based web application for holding scrum planning poker üÉè. This application was built to build a deeper understanding of OTP, concurrency, and the Elixir ecosystem. I intentionally built this application without a larger framework like Phoenix so that I would have the chance to implement key OTP concepts on my own.
